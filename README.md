# CASN Kemenag

## Installation & updates

Clone `git@github.com:danuri/casnkemenag.git` then `composer install` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Create`.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.
